<p>My name is Scott Zhou, and my Chinese name is Siyuan. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Univerity of Washington. I enjoy working on both front end and back end including project design, implementation, optimization and monitoring. </p>
<p>I am passionate about programming which makes me quickly learn new technologies and always looking for challenges to extend my knowledge of software development.</p>
<p>My goal in programming is ONLY COMPILE ONCE!</p>
