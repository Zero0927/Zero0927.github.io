  In this project, I implement a hash table by: 
  creating a table with 32768 (2^15) buckets.
  creating a hash function that for any key will produce an integer in the range[0...32767].
  implmenting get and put mehotds that hash a key and then retrieve or store a value from the proper bucket.
  uses linear probing to handle collisions.
