  In this project, I implement a Huffman's coding algorithm in a CodingTree class. 
  This algorithm counting the frequency of characters in a text file.
  Creating one tree for each character with a non-zero count. 
  Labelling the single tree's left branches with a 0 and right branches with a 1 and reading the code for the characters stored in leaf nodes from the path from root to leaf.
  Using the code for each character to create a compressed encoding of the message.
