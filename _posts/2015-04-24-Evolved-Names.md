  In this project, I implement the majorty code part and my partner did the complexity analysis.
  
  Imagine a virtual world in which all that exists are strings of characters 
  from the set { A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, _, -, '}
  
 Strings in this world can reproduce new strings and die if they are not fit enough. 
 I evolve strings in this world until they spell my name.
