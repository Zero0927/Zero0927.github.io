The Burger Baron has customers that will order in different ways and he wants his menus to automatically construct the burger ingredients in the proper order so he can display it to his gourmet burger chef’s. 
Here are some sample orders: 
● Single Veggie Baron Burger.
● Double Baron Burger with no Cheese but Mozzarella. 
● Single Burger with Veggies but no Lettuce.
● Double Chicken Burger with Ketchup Cheddar Onions and Mushrooms.

  I used the MyStack class as a linked strucutre and write complexity analysis correspond it.
