This is my first hands project to build GUI with Python tkinter.

The program random generate a number from 0 to 1024. User can input any number.
It keep tracks the user input and shrink the number range with displaying on GUI.
For example if the right number is 50, the user input 60 will make the progame update the range from 0-1024 to 0-60.

I am using Python 3.x for this one.
